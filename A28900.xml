            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62515:13"/>Spirit of God in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture directs, That a ſpecial Care be taken in the choice of a Wife, or of a Husband;
<note place="margin">

               </note> according to the Rule of the bleſſed Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.39.) <hi>That they marry in the Lord;</hi> That is, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Chriſtian by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel; as an <hi>Arabian</hi> Interpreter conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (which Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> noteth). But religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and in the fear of God, as other god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned Divines judge. That in their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62515:13"/>choice they reſpect a Religion; for thus Marriages are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted more proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and a bleſſing may be expected, when the married par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties both fear God. Such being pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced bleſſed by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, Pſal. 112.1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in his Commandements: His ſeed ſhall be mighty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the upright ſhall be bleſſed: Wealth and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſhall be in his houſe, and his righteouſneſſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62515:14"/>endure for ever.</hi> And again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128. The ſame Prophet King <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh the ſame in effect, inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed is every one that feareth the Lord, that walketh in his wayes; for thou ſhalt eat the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of thy hands, happy ſhalt thou be, and it ſhall be well with thee: Thy wife ſhall be as the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Vine by the ſides of thy houſe; thy Children like the Olive plants, round about thy Table: Behold, that thus ſhall the man be bleſſed that feareth the Lord; the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62515:14"/>Lord ſhall bleſs thee out of</hi> Zion, <hi>and thou ſhalt ſee the good of</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>all the dayes of thy life; yea, thou ſhalt ſee thy childrens children, and peace upon</hi> Iſrael. Thus an excellent bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing comes to them that fear God; But on the contrary part, when the Man or Woman is an Idolater, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical, Prophane or Deboiſt; without the fear of God, any way wicked by Education, Cuſtome, or Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Curſe may rather be expected then a Bleſſing, That Kingly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62515:15"/>Preacher, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.12, 13. giveth this evidence, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a Sinner do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil an hundred times, and his dayes be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed; yet I know it ſhall be well with them that fear God, which reverence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: But it ſhall not be well with the wicked, neither ſhall he prolong his dayes, which are as a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; becauſe he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not before God. It fell out thus with the old World,

               </note> when the Sons of God, the Children of religious

<note place="margin">Gen 7.1, 3.</note> that is, the Poſterities of Prophane and that wicked <hi>Cain;</hi> and they that were, or ſhould have been Gods Children, made choice of theſe prophane irreligious Wives; they provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God to anger, and he brought in the Flood upon the world of the Ungodly,

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62515:16"/>where ſcarce a form of Religion is to be found; Strangers from prayers to God, nor Morning, nor Evening Prayer to be heard; although God renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Mercies every Morning,
<note place="margin">Lamen. 3.22, 23.</note> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth his goodneſs to the Night: Though he declare his moſt gracious Prefence with us,
<note place="margin">Exod. 13.21.</note> as it were by a Pillar of a Cloud by Day, and a Pillar of Fire by Night; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God hath been a Defence to their Tabernacles, and they have dwelt ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <note place="margin">Daniel 6.10.</note> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious King <hi>David, Pſal.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 55.17.</note> 55. who kept acquaintance with God three times a day; <hi>At morning, and evening, and noon day will I pray, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, and he ſhall hear my voice, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore they are ſtrangers from God,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62515:17"/>when they ſhould ſtand in need of his help, and want that good which they might enjoy by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquaintance with God, of which <hi>Elip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz</hi> doth witneſs, <hi>Job</hi> 22.21. That graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practice of ſecret Prayer which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour directs unto, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Thou, when thou prayeſt enter into thy Cloſet, and ſhut to thy door, and pray to thy Father in ſecret; and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret ſhall reward thee openly.</hi> How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpend ſo much time
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62515:18"/>openly in vain, that they have no leiſure for ſecret Devotions, to read and meditate of heavenly things, which pertain to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or to poure out their Souls as <hi>Hannah</hi> did to God in Prayer.
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.15.</note> Alas, if ſins of omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were the only irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſneſs or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs in ſome Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, it were leſſe, although for theſe men ſhall be called to an account at the Day of the laſt Judgment, witneſs what our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord and Saviour declareth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62515:18"/>42. But their ſins of Commiſſion, common breach of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, witneſs little fear of God to be before their eyes; What common ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and taking of Gods name in vain, forgetting that God threatens he will not hold ſuch guitleſſe that take his Name in vain, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.7. or did men remember that of the Lord, by the Prophet <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.7. <hi>How ſhall I Pardon thee for this, thy Children have forſaken me, and ſworn by them that are no
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62515:19"/>Gods.</hi> Men, yea Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, would not ſwear ſo commonly by thoſe things which they themſelves will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe are no Gods: How difficult a thing is it to hire a Servant from amongſt the common ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<note place="margin">Read Rom. 12.14. Pſal. 109.17, 18. And Mat. 5.34, 35, 36, 37. James 5.12.</note> but they are Swearers or Curſers, or both, and ſo Gods Name is diſhonoured. Children learn of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to be irreligious, and this too often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Rich as well as Poor; I ſay but little of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſin too often in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62515:19"/>greater Families, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing men to Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by that ſpecious pretence of pledging Healths of Friends; preſſing men in Drink,
<note place="margin">Read Hab: 2:2.15, 16. <hi>A dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Woe to ſuch.</hi>
               </note> contrary to that Law and Practice of that Moral Prince, King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> that none ſhould compel to Drink, <hi>Heſter</hi> 2.8. But every one be free to drink what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: a ſhame to men that profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians. I know in divers great Families, there is civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, if not a religious reſpect to avoid theſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62515:20"/>ſins; But when theſe abound, and men, or women raſhly unite themſelves in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, what hope of conſtant happy Love to continue between Husband and Wife during life?</p>
            <p>I proceed to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Gold-link of Love between Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife,
<note place="margin">The ſecond Gold-link of Love.</note> that in choice of a Wife or Husband, as reſpect is to be had for likeneſſe and agreement in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſo likewiſe to equality, or likeneſs of qualities, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as near as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62515:20"/>
            <p>For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth not to be une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually yoaked with Unbelievers, ſo he preſſeth his Counſel with a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>What fellowſhip</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs with unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion hath Light with Darkneſs,</hi> (2 Cor. 6.14.) So even right reaſon will inſtruct us, and daily experience witneſs, that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diſpoſitions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or too great ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities, ſeldom live comfortably together; as Fire and Water
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62515:21"/>will not agree, the one exſiccateth or quencheth the other. But like rejoyceth, and delighteth with the like. Obſerve this Rule then, for this is a ſecond Direction or Gold-link of Love, to preſerve Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Husband and Wife.</p>
            <p>A third Direction,
<note place="margin">A third Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or Gold-link of Love.</note> or Gold-link of Love followeth: And this is, That ſome fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect be had to the age of the Parties to be married; for a young man of twenty to marry an old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62515:21"/>man of above three-ſcore, or for an old man of fourſcore to marry a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man under twenty, is not agreeable; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one chief end of Marriage is in danger to be fruſtrate,
<note place="margin">Gen. 1.27, 28.</note> which is Poſterity to be brought up in the fear and admonition of the Lord, as Sr. <hi>Paul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth, (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.4.) Although it is more fit for a very old man to marry a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in hope of Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then for a very old woman paſt child-bearing, to marry a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62515:22"/>young man. Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and conveniency do beſt agree together for the preſervation of Conjugal Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Husband and Wife; and this is a third Gold-Link in this Gold Chain of Direction, to keep and bind Love faſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Husband and Wife during their Lives.</p>
            <p>The fourth Direction,
<note place="margin">A fourth Direction, or Gold-link of love.</note> or Gold-Link of Love in a marriage Union; there ought to be likeneſſe and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of affection, a mutual love and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62515:22"/>of each others perſons and qualities, and a knitting and uniting of Hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in a right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Love before the joyning of Hands on the Wedding-Day. For where there is an Antipathy or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Natures, or diſlike of Perſons or Conditions, there ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is a continuance of ſweet agreement and ſatisfaction one to and with another, and ſo Marriage proveth a Bondage; inſtead of a ſweet freedom in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62515:23"/>a happy enjoyment of each other in the Lord, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to enjoy, and have joy of <hi>Philemon</hi> in the Lord,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>his Epiſtle to</hi> Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>verſe</hi> 20.</note> in whom what we enjoy is a bleſſing by Chriſt; whereas if the Hearts be truly knit together, and united in Love, as the heart of <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 18.1.</note> who loved him as his own Soul; the Love will be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, as was <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> paſſing the love of Women.
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 1.26.</note> Although the love of good women to their Husbands hath been
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62515:23"/>wonderful, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories do witneſſe at full. I mean not a light unconſtant paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Love taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſight of Beauty or Riches, or ſome ſuch uncertain foundation, which is deceitful, and vain as King <hi>Solomon</hi> witneſſes. Firſt of Riches, Prov. 23.5. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thy Eyes upon that which is not, for Riches certainly make themſelves Wings and fly away as Eagles towards Heaven.</hi> They are uncertain,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.17.</note> and not to be truſted in. And
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62515:24"/>again, the like for Beauty, <hi>Favour is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, and Beauty is vanity; But a Woman that feareth the Lord ſhe ſhall be praiſed,</hi> Prov. 31.30. When a right grounded love in the fear of the Lord (which is praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy) is permanent, and will endure for life: I know upon ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
<note place="margin">A preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> there may want time and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſuch a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Converſe with each other, which may be helpful to ſuch a well grounded love as between great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62515:24"/>who are conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Wooe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede ſometimes by Ambaſſadors, as <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Geneſis 24 1, 2, 63.</note> that religious Prince did by the religious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of his honourable Father <hi>Abraham;</hi> I call <hi>Abraham</hi> honourable, for he is ſtiled a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Prince:
<note place="margin">Geneſis 23.6.</note> And this Ambaſſadour went to intercede for a Wife for <hi>Iſaac.</hi> This done by his Maſters Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and no doubt with <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s conſent, who was adviſed by his Father in choice of his Wife; as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beckah</hi> was by her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who willingly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62515:25"/>ſent her with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Servant, yet ſo as <hi>Rebeckah</hi> firſt was asked her conſent alſo, as you may read at large,
<note place="margin">Gen. 24.57, 58.</note> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>Thus religious <hi>Iſaac</hi> walking out into the Fields at Eventide to meditate and pray,
<note place="margin">Gen. 24.63.</note> eſpieth his <hi>Rebeckah</hi> coming, goeth on to meet her, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her into his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Tent, and ſhe became his Wife, and he loved her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.67. Thus a good choice with love and Gods bleſſing made a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62515:25"/>happy Marriage to both their joyes, and no doubt to the joy of aged <hi>Abraham,</hi> that bleſſed Father of the Faithful. And thus you have a fourth Gold-link in this Gold Chain of Love.</p>
            <p>I will give you but one Preparative Gold link of Love more;
<note place="margin">A fifth Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or Gold link of Love.</note> And this is, That not only Parents conſent and bleſſing may be had (if poſſible) (as no doubt <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beckah</hi> had) and their bleſſing. <hi>And ſhe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> Rebeckah, <hi>and ſaid, be thou the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<note place="margin">A ſixth Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or Gold-link of Love.</note> for a joyful happy life in a married eſtate, is that the married Parties ought to labour for a daily increaſe of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.7. 2 Pet. 3.18.</note> and to get aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that they are both of them married to Chriſt,

<note place="margin">Iſa. 9.6.</note> He is an everlaſting Father to take care and provide for his Spouſe the Church.
<note place="margin">Rev. 1.18.</note> A heavenly Husband that never dieth, but liveth ever to provide for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Spouſe, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soul that is united in marriage to him.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 54.5.</note> He is a bleſſed Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, whoſe Name is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62515:28"/>the Lord of Hoſts, and our Redeemer;
<note place="margin">Mat. 18.20. Mat. 28.20.</note> a Saviour who hath promiſed to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his Church, his Beloved, to the end of the World. And to deliver in greateſt danger,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 43.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> in fiery Afflictions, it ſhall not burn them, in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try they ſhall not be drowned: There is no better, yea, none ſo good a Husband as Chriſt, none to be loved ſo much as our heavenly Huband the Lord Jeſus.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62515:29"/>increaſe of our love to Chriſt, becauſe he loved us firſt, (1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19.) And as we ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed every day more and more in love to Chriſt. So ought Husbands and Wives to endeavour truly to cheriſh, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and preſerve mutual Love, to and with each other, as the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for his Chriſtian <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 3.17, 18, 19.</note> that Chriſt may dwell in their Hearts by Faith, that being rooted and grounded in Love,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62515:29"/>they may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the bredth, and length, and depth, and height of that love of God, which paſſeth Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; they may be filled (and ſatisfied) with the fulneſſe of God. So Husbands and Wives being rooted and grounded in Love, may be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with each others Love, as that wiſe King <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſeth:
<note place="margin">Prov. 5.18, 19.</note> I ſpeak not of a meer carnal Love, which will not make their Souls happy; but of a

<note place="margin">Cant. 2.3. Cant. 8.6, 7.</note> like the Love of Chriſt to his Church; A Tree new ſet or plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, may eaſily be plucked up again. But if it hath taken root, and be well grown, it will abide both wind and weather; and a true fervent Love, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Waters cannot
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62515:30"/>quench it, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of that Love between Chriſt and his Church, it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure during the Lives of the Lovers, to their Rejoycings, as being ſealed with Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſetled in the Heart. This is a ſixth Gold-link of Love.</p>
            <p>A ſeventh Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<note place="margin">A ſeventh Direction, or Gold-link of Love.</note> or Gold-link of Love, to enjoy happy contentment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Husband and Wife, is this, That there ought to be free Communication of mutual kindneſs, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62515:31"/>conjugal engagements one to and with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that mutual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, and Bond of Marriage-Love, at times convenient, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of God and Nature; read the bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Direction, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2, 3, 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and that Law of God, <hi>Leviticus</hi> 18.19. and <hi>Leviticus</hi> 20.18. and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18.6. Theſe Rules obſerved, This Marriage-kindneſs at fit times is one means to cheriſh and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve mutual conjugal Love between Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62515:31"/>and Wives; when as the denial of this loving kindneſſe is a dangerous occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Breach and Diſquietneſſe; yea, ſometimes it may prove of ſeparation, and an occaſion of Damnable ſin (if God reſtrain not by his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace); yet a Bridle muſt be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain Intemperance in all Delights, leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs deſtroy both Souls and Bodies; That is a general Rule (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.5.) <hi>Let your moderation be known to all men, the Lord is at

            <p>The eighth follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
<note place="margin">The eighth Direction, or Gold-link of Love.</note> And this is, That Husbands and Wives be careful of, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſhew their love to each others Souls, as well as to their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or Eſtates: That Husbands love their Wives as Chriſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Spouſe the Church, and gave
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62515:32"/>himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the Word, that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle,

            <p>Husbands ought to take care for the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Wives Souls as well as of their Bodies; that they may be lovely to Chriſt their heavenly Husbands, as well as
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62515:33"/>to them,

               <hi>Paul</hi> did for his Chriſtian <hi>Theſsaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,, That her whole Spirit, Soul and Body be preſerved blameleſs to the coming of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Christ.</hi> The Soul is better then a whole World;
<note place="margin">Mat. 16.26.</note> 
               <hi>What is a man profited, if he gain the

And if it be a Duty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the Body of his Family or Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, then much more for their moſt pretious and immortal Souls (if it poſſible be in his power), and moſt of all for his Wives
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62515:34"/>Soul, which is his ſecond Self, and is, or ought to be moſt dear unto his Soul. That her Soul may proſper, as St. <hi>John</hi> did teſtifie of the Soul of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Gaius;</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 John 1.2.</note> That it may appear, he loveth his Wife in Truth; and ſo God may bleſs her unto him, for the good of his Soul, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Eſtate.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62515:34"/>This is a means by Gods bleſſing, for the preſervation of conjugal Love, and gratious affections for true joy of Husband and Wife, by the Grace and Power of Chriſt.
<note place="margin">John 15.15. Phil. 4.13.</note> For Husbands and Wives ought to be helpers, and means in their places of each others Salvation; this St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimateth, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.16.) requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cohabitation and dwelling together; and he expreſſeth a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>What knoweſt thou, O Wife, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy Husband;

            <p>Now I proceed to a ninth Gold-link,
<note place="margin">A ninth Direction, or Gold-link of Love.</note> in this Golden Chain of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62515:36"/>Love.

And the wife ought to be careful, not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke her husband by any unkind behaviour towards him, but to be ready to ſhew her love to her husband in ſickneſs and health, and both to look to the example of Chriſt our heavenly husband. <hi>The husband to love his wife as his own Body; for he that loveth his

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62515:38"/>Breach, would I have Chriſt, my Lord and ſpirituall husband, ſo unkind to me, as I am to my wife; and may the wife ſay, would I have Chriſt ſo unkind to me, to forſake my ſoul, or withdraw his love from me, as I have done from my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and ſo may the husband ſay in reſpect of his wife.

            <p>The twelfth Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<note place="margin">A twelfth Direction, or Gold-link of Love.</note> or Gold-link of Love, is, That ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, or both
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62515:48"/>of them have a ſpecial Care of their mutual Duties, to give right and due reſpect to each other. Firſt, the Wife to honour and reverence her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band as her Head, and to obey him in all things lawful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient in the Lord, as <hi>Sarah</hi> (that great Lady) did honour and obey <hi>Abraham</hi> her Husband, calling him Lord, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.6. I ſay, Obey him in all things lawful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient in the Lord: For as this is the rule of Childrens Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62515:48"/>to their Parents, given by the Spirit of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.1. So it is the rule of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours to obey their Superiours in all things lawful in the Lord; yea, expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently alſo it is to be reſpected. A Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band may not proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute his Wives Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity or Honour, as he may not proſtitute his Daughter to be a Whore, as you may read, <hi>Leviticus</hi> 19.29. Nor Husband nor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can lawfully Command a Wife or Daughter to conſent
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62515:49"/>to ſuch a ſin; nor is either Wife or Daughter bound to obey in ſuch ſinful Commands; no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour hath power to command an Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to ſin againſt Gods Command: The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to ſuch unlawful Commands of Men or Women is ſet down by the Holy Ghoſt, Acts 5.20. <hi>It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to obey God then Man.</hi> Theſe unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Commands will ſtop the current of Love between Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife. For as the Wife is to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62515:49"/>the Husband as her Head, ſo the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is no way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, or ſeek to diſhonour his Wife, but to honour her as the weaker Veſſel, as a Coheir with him of the Grace of Life, as the Apoſtle directs, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.7. This li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving together as heirs of the Grace of Life, muſt be of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to his Wife, as to a Companion, and Fellow in the Bonds of Marriage, as may be intimated, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. For when God made the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62515:50"/>as he did not take her out of the Head of <hi>Adam,</hi> to be above him, ſo he did not take her out of <hi>Adams</hi> Feet, to be trampled upon; but out of his Side, near to his Heart, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.21, 22. to be honoured and loved as his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Helper, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Companion. And this kind reſpect on both ſides is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent means and help to preſerve Love between Husband and Wife to the end.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:62515:50"/>
            <p>The thirteenth Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<note place="margin">The thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or Gold-link of Love.</note> or Gold-link of Love, is, That both husband and wife be mutually carefull in their places for the preſervation or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their Eſtate and Proviſion, and Government of their Houſhold or Family, and provide both for the preſent and for the future. This care of the Husband, and his Duty, we may learn from that great Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. <hi>If any man provide not for his own, eſpecially for thoſe of his own Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62515:51"/>he hath denied the Faith, and is worſe then an Infidel.</hi> That was good Counſel of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 27.23, 24. <hi>Be thou diligent to know the ſtate of thy Flocks, and look well to thy Herds: For Riches are not for ever, and doth the Crown endure to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Generation?</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is requiſite to preſerve an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</p>
            <p>I remember it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove threeſcore years ſince when I was in <hi>Oxford,</hi> I did ſee a little Book of good Counſel, writ by a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62515:51"/>noble Lord to his Son, in which he adviſed his Son to divide his Eſtate into three parts. Firſt, one part he might ſpend in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Expences, Houſe-keeping, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel, and ſuch like. A ſecond part lay aſide for extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions for himſelf and the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. And a third part to lay up for increaſe of his Eſtate. If a man ſpend beyond his Eſtate, or live at the higheſt rate of his Incomings, he will be conſtrained to live of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62515:52"/>borrowing, and ſo of borrowing in the end, if in time he labour not to prevent. And for the wife alſo, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> giveth an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Deſcription of a virtuous woman, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.10, 11, 12. to the end of that Chapter, read it at your leiſure, Verſes 27.28. He ſaith a virtuous woman, <hi>She looketh well to the wayes of her Houſhold, and eateth not the Bread of idleneſſe; her Children riſe up and call her bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he Husband alſo, and he praiſeth her, &amp;c.</hi> He
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62515:52"/>concludeth, <hi>Give her of the fruit of her Hands, and let her own workes praiſe her in the Gates.</hi> The good wife will conſider her husbands eſtate, and not preſſe him to ſpend above power; She will do her husband good, and not hurt all the dayes of her life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.12. Thus whon there is a mutual providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al care of husband and wife for themſelves, Family and Poſterity. This is an eſpeciall Gold-link of Love, to bind love faſt between husband and wife.</p>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62515:54"/>through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus. This is life eternal to know God, the onely true God, and whom he hath ſent Jeſus Christ,</hi> John 17.3. For this care of inſtructing Children and Family, the Lord himſelf commended faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> and maketh him of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Counſel; <hi>Shall I hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>the thing that I do?</hi> And he giveth this for one Reaſon, <hi>For I know him</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>that he will Command his Children, and his Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold

And Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are commanded to hearken to their Parents inſtruction, Prov. 1.8. <hi>My Son, hear the Inſtruction of thy Father, and forget not the Law of thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> And again, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.1. you may find the words of King <hi>Lemuel,</hi> the Prophecy which his Mother taught him. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the Apoſtle St.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62515:55"/>
               <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3, 4. preſſeth the duty both of Children and Parents. Firſt, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren obey your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in all things, as it is fit in the Lord; and honour thy Father and Mother, which is the firſt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with promiſe, That it may be well with thee, and thou mayeſt live long in the Land: And Fathers, provoke not your Children to wrath, that they be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, but bring them up in the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Admonition
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62515:56"/>of the Lord. Thus Children well inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the knowledge of God's mind, may be a joy to Parents, and Parents enjoy their Children as bleſſings from the Lord, and behold them as Olive branches round about their Table to God's Glory,

<note place="margin">The ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or Gold-link of Love.</note> or Gold-link of Love now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: This is to exerciſe ſpiritual wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, how and when to ſpeak one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62515:63"/>of any thing that is not well done, or ſaid by either party, or that they perceive is contrary to either of their minds or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or not for their profit, ſafety or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; A word fitly ſpoken in due ſeaſon, how good is it, ſaith King <hi>Solomon?</hi> Prov. 15.23. And Prov. 25.11. <hi>A word fitly ſpoken, is like Apples of Gold in pictures of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> And the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Preacher telleth us, there is a time for all things, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.1. For that which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62515:64"/>may be well taken at one time, which will not be ſo well reſented at another time.</p>
            <p>For Example,
<note place="margin" type="runSum">Example.</note>when Churliſh covetous <hi>Nabal</hi> had uſed <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> young men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly, and brought himſelf and Family in great danger, we ſee <hi>Abigail</hi> meeting <hi>David</hi> with a Preſent, and pacifieth <hi>David,</hi> and prevents his ſhedding of Blood, as you may read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.26. and returning home, ſhe findeth her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band keeping a Feaſt
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62515:64"/>like a King, and merry with Wine; for he was very Drunken, <hi>verſe</hi> 36. wherefore ſhe told him nothing leſs or more, untill the morning. But it came to paſs in the morning, when the Wine was gone out of <hi>Nabal,</hi> then ſhe told him theſe things, and then he was ſenſible of his folly to the full, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.37.
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.37.</note> Thus when a Husband or Wife is in any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, drunken with Wine or ſtrong drink, or with any paſſion or diſcontent; it is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62515:65"/>to forbear ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and to obſerve a ſit time, and in a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving manner to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare mildly and peaceably what was a failing on either part, and that with meekneſſe of ſpirit; <hi>For a ſoft Anſwer turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away wrath, but grievous words ſtir up Anger,</hi> as we noted before, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.10.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62515:66"/>duty St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 1 Cor. 7.33, 34. <hi>The married man careth for the things of this World, how he may pleaſe his wife, and the married woman how ſhe may pleaſe her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi> The Apoſtle holdeth this out (I humbly conceive) not only as a practice, but as a Chriſtian duty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, to be careful both Husband and Wife, to pleaſe one another in all things lawful and convenient in the Lord; for <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3. He giveth this Rule for Chriſtians in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62515:66"/>general, That the ſtrong ought to bear the Infirmities of the weak, and not to pleaſe our ſelves; But let every one pleaſe his Neighbour to Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Now if this be the duty of all Chriſtians to pleaſe one another for their good; Then much more of Husbands and Wives to be well-pleaſing to each other, not to be contentious or quarrelſome, or croſs for Trifles, or ſmall Matters; but to be wiſe, and ſeek to pleaſe, and give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62515:67"/>to each other, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Places. This is heavenly wiſdome, ſaith St. <hi>James,</hi> which is from above, and is firſt pure, then peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, gentle, and eaſie to be intreated, full of mercy, and good fruits, without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and without hypocriſie, <hi>James</hi> 3.17, 18. And this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Husband and Wife, to be peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, not troubleſome to each other. For as the wiſe man ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>He that troubleth
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62515:67"/>his own Houſe, ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Wind, and the Fool ſhall be ſervant to the wiſe in heart,</hi> Prov. 11.29. And Prov. 19.13, 11. <hi>A fooliſh Son is the calamity of his Father, and the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Wife are a continual dropping;</hi> it will rot a houſe in time. And again, <hi>Houſes and Riches are the Inheritance of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; But a prudent Wife is from the Lord,</hi> Prov. 19.14. <hi>A conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Wife will trouble a Family, and bring diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs to a quiet Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi> Therefore the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62515:68"/>Wife is to be peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and the ſame ought to be the care of the Husband, not to be captious &amp; chiding with his Wife for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſmall thing he ſeeth amiſſe; But to follow the Apoſtles Rule, 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 4.11.
